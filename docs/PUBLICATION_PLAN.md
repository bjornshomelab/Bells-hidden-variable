## 📋 Zenodo Metadata (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Title:**  
The Field as Bell's Hidden Variable: A Non-Local Ontological Interpretation

**Creators:**  
Björn Wikström (ORCID: 0009-0000-4015-2357)

**Affiliation:**  
Base76 Research Lab, Skåne, Sweden

**Description:**  
Bell's theorem excludes local hidden variables but leaves open the question of non-local ontological grounds. This paper argues that the Field–Node–Cockpit (FNC) framework provides such a ground: not as a physical mechanism within observation, but as the precondition for observation itself.

The FNC Field is:
- Non-local by definition (globally simultaneous information substrate)
- Hidden ontologically (condition-of-appearance, not object-within-appearance)
- Compatible with quantum correlations (shared informational basis)
- No-signaling preserving (Field-access is local collapse, not information transfer)

This completes the FNC theoretical circle, linking quantum foundations to consciousness research through a substrate-neutral ontology.

## 📊 Significance

**Completes FNC Trilogy:**
1. ✅ The Shared Mind (2024) — Initial framework
2. ✅ From Frequency to Field (2025) — Empirical methodology
3. ⏳ **Bell's Hidden Variable (2025) — Quantum foundations** ← TOMORROW

**Strategic Impact:**
- Theoretical completion before PhD applications
- Demonstrates philosophical rigor + technical depth
- Connects consciousness research to physics foundations
- Strengthens academic legitimacy
- Provides unique positioning (philosophy + physics + AI)

**Timeline Alignment:**
- Published before 2026 (important for CV dating)
- Available for PhD application materials (Q1 2026)
- Supports visiting scholar applications
- Enhances FNC-compliance credibility
